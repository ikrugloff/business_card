            <p>Hello,<br>
                <br>
                My name is {{ first_name | title}}, I'm {{ age }} years old. I live and work in Moscow. My life value
                and the main motivation is personal development and discovery of new opportunities in myself and the
                world around me. In life and at work I like to communicate with people, to inspire new things, to get
                new knowledge, to expand my horizons, to be proactive, to live in the present and go all the way.<br>
                Today I work as an engineer for a cellular communication operator - PJSC "MegaFon". Things are going
                well enough and often my boss puts me as an example of how to work other should. Maintenance, support
                and implementation of industrial billing systems allowed me to get a broad view of how real-time systems
                work, which a huge number of different subsystems need to interact seamlessly, in order to communication
                is available to any person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, understand the intricacies of configuring such
                systems.<br>
                Today I want to go further. Therefore, since 2017, I began to study such disciplines as relational
                databases, Linux OS and software testing.
                In early 2018, I enrolled at GeekBrains University at the department of web development on Python.
                Experience in the company PJSC "MegaFon" and projects in GB University helped me to acquire the
                following skills:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full stack development;</li>
                    <li>Project management as a team lead;</li>
                    <li>Configuration and implementation of industrial billing systems;</li>
                    <li>Automated testing.</li>
                </ul>
                With a list of technical skills and projects implemented by me, you can see on the page "My Skills"
                (which includes links to my GitHub.com account and other internet resources on which information about
                me is presented).<br>
                Due to the fact that I'd like to be a developer in development company and dealing exclusively with my
                favorite business I wrote this appeal. Change of professional activities and new tasks will help me to
                apply the experience gained in the development, testing and supporting billing software. The transition
                to a new stage is very important for me and for my family, my loved ones.<br>
                I ask you to consider my appeal and give me a chance to come for an interview for a personal
                acquaintance with your company.<br>
                <br>
                Yours faithfully,<br>
